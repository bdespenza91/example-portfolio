6 **Error Guessing**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify system behavior when feedback is not entered.
        - **Input**: Submit rating without feedback.
        - **Expected Outcome**: Rating submitted successfully (feedback optional).

7. **Use Case Testing**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify average rating calculation is correct.

4. **Equivalence Partitioning**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify access for users below 18 years.
        - **Input**: Date of Birth = (Today - 17 years).
        - **Expected Outcome**: Access denied.

5. **Equivalence Partitioning**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify access for users above 18 years.
        - **Input**: Date of Birth = (Today - 25 years).
        - **Expected Outcome**: Access granted.

6. **Error Guessing**:
    - **Test Case**: Verify system behavior when date of birth is not entered.
        - **Input**: Empty input field.
        - **Expected Outcome**: Error message "Date of Birth is required."
